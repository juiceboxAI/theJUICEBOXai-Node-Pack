# theJUICEBOXai-Node-Pack
Custom QOL nodes from theJUICEBOX for use with ComfyUI. 
This is a personal project to create QOL nodes for use in my ComfyUI workflows. This project also serves as a learning playground, I am by no means an expert. Code is written/reviewed with AI support.

Node List
- Latent Presets


Node Descriptions
- Latent Presets:
  This node provices a set of useful presets for using in image generation. All presets are 1:1 or Landscape with the   option to       toggle for Portrait. This helped keep the list managable and make sense. I tried to cover all the useable resoltuions you   would     want to use or start to upscale from. It's favorite color is purple.
